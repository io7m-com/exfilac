    <Paragraph>
      This section of the documentation describes the implementation or
      <Term type="term">theory of operation</Term>
      for the application. Knowing how the application works internally can be useful when trying to determine why
      something doesn't appear to be working the way it should be.

    <Subsection title="android.permission.INTERNET">
      <Paragraph>
        The application requires the <Term type="constant">android.permission.INTERNET</Term> permission in order to
        talk to external S3 servers.

    <Subsection title="android.permission.CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE">
      <Paragraph>
        The application requires the <Term type="constant">android.permission.CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE</Term> permission in
        order to determine if networking is currently available. Unfortunately, Android requires applications to use the
        <Term type="constant">android.permission.CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE</Term>
        permission just to read the networking state, even if they have no intention of
        <Term type="term">changing</Term>
        the network state. Bizarrely, Android also exposes an
        <Term type="constant">android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE</Term>
        permission, but this apparently is not sufficient to access the
        <Term type="class">ConnectivityManager</Term>
        class used to monitor the networking status.

    <Subsection title="android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED">
      <Paragraph>
        The application requires the
        <Term type="constant">android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED</Term>
        permission in order to be notified that the device has finished booting up. The application starts up a
        background service that will periodically schedule uploads. This ensures that users don't need to remember to
        start the application every time they reboot their device; forgetting to start the application might mean that
        critical data backups don't get executed!

        The application requires the

        permission in order to use camera to scan QR codes to configure buckets.
